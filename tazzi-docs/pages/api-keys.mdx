# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Tazzi API. This guide covers how to create, manage, and secure your API keys.

## Creating an API Key

1. Log in to your [Tazzi dashboard](https://app.tazzi.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Server", "Mobile App")
5. Select the environment: **Test** or **Live**
6. (Optional) Set permissions for restricted access
7. Click **Create**
8. **Copy your API key immediately** - it won't be shown again!

<Warning>
Store your API key securely. You won't be able to view it again after creation.
</Warning>

## Key Format

Test keys and live keys have different prefixes:

- **Test keys**: `tazzi_test_abc123...`
- **Live keys**: `tazzi_live_xyz789...`

## Managing API Keys

### View All Keys

See all your API keys in the dashboard:
- Key name and description
- Environment (test/live)
- Created date
- Last used timestamp
- Usage statistics

### Revoke a Key

To revoke an API key:
1. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Confirm the action

<Warning>
Revoking a key is immediate and cannot be undone. All requests using that key will fail.
</Warning>

### Rotate Keys

Best practice: Rotate API keys every 90 days.

1. Create a new API key
2. Update your application with the new key
3. Test thoroughly
4. Revoke the old key after 24-48 hours
