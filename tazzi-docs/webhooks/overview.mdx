# Webhooks Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your Tazzi account.

## How Webhooks Work

1. Configure a webhook URL in your dashboard
2. Select which events to receive
3. Tazzi sends HTTP POST requests to your URL when events occur
4. Your server responds with 200 OK

## Setting Up Webhooks

1. Go to **Settings → Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Endpoint**
3. Enter your webhook URL
4. Select event types
5. Save

## Webhook Payload Structure
