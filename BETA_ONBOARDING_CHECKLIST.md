Subject: Early Access to IRISX - Multi-Channel Communications API

Hi [Name],

I'm launching IRISX, a new communications platform for voice, SMS, and email.

We're looking for 5 beta partners to help us refine the product. Beta customers get:
- $100 in free credits (no credit card required)
- Direct access to our engineering team
- Influence on feature roadmap
- Discounted pricing after beta (50% off for 6 months)

Our API is simpler than Twilio with better pricing ($0.015/min vs $0.025/min for voice).

Interested? Reply and I'll send you access details.

Thanks,
Ryan
Founder, IRISX
```
