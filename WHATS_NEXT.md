# IRISX Platform - What's Next (Post Week 19)

**Date:** November 1, 2025
**Current Progress:** ~60% Complete
**Last Completed:** Week 19 Part 5 - Agent Provisioning Enhancements

---

## Executive Summary

Week 19 was a MASSIVE success - we achieved full agent provisioning automation with welcome emails and bulk import. The voice infrastructure is production-ready with outbound/inbound calling, WebRTC browser calling, and auto-configuration.

The platform now has strong foundations in:
- Voice (outbound, inbound, WebRTC, agent provisioning)
- SMS (7 carriers with LCR routing)
- Email (sending, templates, automation)
- WhatsApp (sending, webhooks, media)
- Social (Discord, Slack, Teams, Telegram)

**What's missing:** Platform admin tools, analytics dashboards, performance monitoring, and production-readiness features.

## Key Metrics to Track

As you build these features, track these KPIs:

### Technical Metrics
- API response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (% of failed requests)
- Database query performance (slow queries > 100ms)
- FreeSWITCH call quality (MOS score)
- Uptime percentage (target: 99.9%)

### Business Metrics
- Active tenants
- Calls per tenant per month
- Messages sent per channel
- Agent productivity (calls/hour)
- Customer churn rate

### Cost Metrics
- AWS infrastructure costs per tenant
- Carrier costs (voice minutes, SMS messages)
- Cost per call/message
- Profit margin per tenant

---

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **Platform Admin:** Who will have admin access? Just you, or will you hire support staff?

2. **Call Queue:** Do we need advanced features like skills-based routing immediately, or start with basic FIFO queue?

3. **Analytics:** What reports are most important for your first customers? Focus on those first.

4. **Billing:** When do you plan to charge customers? This affects when we need billing system.

5. **Security:** Do you need SOC 2 compliance? This affects infrastructure choices.

6. **Scale:** How many concurrent calls do you expect in the first 6 months? (This affects FreeSWITCH scaling.)
