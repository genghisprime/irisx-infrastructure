# IRIS Quick Start Guide - Optimized for AI-Assisted Development

**Purpose:** Get Claude building code FAST. Everything optimized for Ryan + Claude development.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started (2 Minutes)

### If Claude Just Woke Up:

**Say this to Claude:**
```
Read QUICK_START_GUIDE.md and let's start building IRIS
```

**Claude will:**
1. Understand the full context (5 seconds)
2. Know exactly what to build (tech stack locked in)
3. Start coding immediately (no questions about architecture)

---

## üìÅ File Organization (Optimized for Claude)

### **Critical Files (In Reading Order):**

```

## üéØ How to Work With Claude

### **Pattern 1: Start New Task**

**You say:**
```
Let's work on Week 2: Database Schema. Create the PostgreSQL migrations.
```

**Claude will:**
1. Read relevant docs (IRIS_Authentication_Identity_RBAC.md, etc.)
2. Generate complete migration files
3. Test the SQL
4. Give you the code

**No back-and-forth. Just code.**

---

### **Pattern 2: Continue Previous Work**

**You say:**
```
Continue from where we left off
```

**Claude will:**
1. Check the checklist for last completed item
2. Read context from previous messages
3. Continue next task
4. Generate code

---

### **Pattern 3: Jump to Specific Feature**

**You say:**
```
Let's build the Hono.js API with POST /v1/calls endpoint
```

**Claude will:**
1. Read API specs from docs
2. Generate Hono.js code
3. Add TypeScript types
4. Include tests
5. Give you working code

---

### **Pattern 4: Fix/Debug**

**You say:**
```
The API is returning 500 errors. Here's the error log: [paste error]
```

**Claude will:**
1. Analyze the error
2. Read relevant code context
3. Identify the issue
4. Generate the fix
5. Explain what was wrong

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (LOCKED IN)

**Don't ask Claude about these - they're decided:**

```javascript
Frontend:  Vue 3.5 + Vite 6 + Tailwind CSS 4
Backend:   Node.js 22 + Hono.js
Database:  AWS RDS PostgreSQL
Cache:     AWS ElastiCache Redis
Storage:   AWS S3 + CloudFront
Real-time: Firebase (FCM + Realtime DB)
Telephony: FreeSWITCH on EC2
Carriers:  Twilio + Telnyx
```

**If Claude suggests changes:** Politely say "tech stack is locked in, let's use what we have"

---

## üìã Development Order (Follow This)

### **Phase 0: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)**
1. AWS setup (RDS, ElastiCache, EC2)
2. Database schema (PostgreSQL migrations)
3. FreeSWITCH setup (Packer AMI, Twilio trunk)

**Goal:** First call works end-to-end

---

### **Phase 1: Core Calling (Weeks 5-12)**
1. TTS integration (OpenAI, cache in S3)
2. Call control verbs (Say, Play, Gather, Record, Transfer)
3. Webhook system (HMAC, retries)
4. Vue 3 customer portal (auth, dashboard, call logs)
5. Documentation (Mintlify)

---

### **Phase 4: Multi-Channel (Weeks 27-30)**
1. SMS (Telnyx, Twilio)
2. Email (AWS SES, Postmark)
3. Social (Facebook, Twitter, Discord)
4. Unified API

**Goal:** All channels working

---

### **Phase 5-6: Enterprise & Advanced (Weeks 31-34)**
1. Multi-carrier + multi-region
2. Security (encryption, SOC 2)
3. AI features (transcription, summaries)
4. Video calling

**Goal:** Enterprise-ready, production launch

---

## üí° Tips for Fast Development

### **1. Be Specific With Tasks**

**‚ùå Bad (vague):**
```
"Build the API"
```

**‚úÖ Good (specific):**
```
"Build Hono.js API with POST /v1/calls endpoint.
Accept: to, from, message.
Publish to NATS.
Return call_id.
Add TypeScript types."
```

**Why:** Claude generates better code with specifics.

---

### **2. Reference the Checklist**

**‚úÖ Good:**
```
"Let's work on Week 2, Task: Design users table with RBAC"
```

**Why:** Checklist has all the details, Claude reads it automatically.

---

### **3. Provide Error Context**

**‚úÖ Good:**
```
"API returning 500 error when calling POST /v1/calls.
Error: 'Cannot read property id of undefined'
Here's my code: [paste code]"
```

**Why:** Claude can fix it in one shot with full context.

---

### **4. Ask for Tests**

**‚úÖ Good:**
```
"Build the database schema AND write Jest tests to verify it"
```

**Why:** Catch bugs early, move faster.

---

### **5. Request Code Comments**

**‚úÖ Good:**
```
"Build the TTS service with detailed comments explaining the caching strategy"
```

**Why:** You'll understand it later, easier to modify.

---

## üî• Fast Iteration Pattern

### **Step 1: Pick Task (30 seconds)**
```
You: "Let's work on Week 4: Build Hono.js API with POST /v1/calls endpoint"
```

### **Step 2: Claude Generates Code (2 minutes)**
```
Claude: [reads API spec, generates complete Hono.js code with types, tests]
```

### **Step 3: You Test (5 minutes)**
```
You: Run the code, test it
```

### **Step 4: Fix Issues (2 minutes)**
```
You: "Getting CORS error, fix it"
Claude: [updates code with CORS middleware]
```

### **Step 5: Mark Complete (10 seconds)**
```
You: Check off task in 00_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md
```

### **Total Time: ~10 minutes per task**

**At this pace:**
- 6 tasks/hour
- 48 tasks/day (8 hours)
- 240 tasks/week
- **500 tasks = ~2 weeks of focused work**

(Realistically: 4-8 weeks with testing, debugging, learning)

## üéØ What Makes This Setup Optimal for AI

### **1. Clear Tech Stack (No Decisions Needed)**
- Claude doesn't waste time asking "should we use Express or Hono?"
- Answer is in TECH_STACK_SUMMARY.md
- Just builds with Hono.js immediately

### **2. Comprehensive Specs (No Guessing)**
- Database schemas fully designed
- API endpoints fully specified
- Architecture decisions made
- Claude just implements

### **3. Organized Checklist (Clear Next Steps)**
- 500+ tasks in dependency order
- Each task is specific
- No "what should I build next?" delays
- Just follow the list top to bottom

### **4. Reference Docs Available (Deep Context)**
- 25 comprehensive guides
- 1,100+ pages of specs
- Code examples throughout
- Claude reads when needed

### **5. Flexible Provider System (No Rewrites)**
- Multi-provider from day 1
- Add/remove providers easily
- No "we need to refactor everything" later
- Built right the first time

## üö® Common Patterns

### **When Claude Crashes Mid-Task:**

**You say:**
```
Read SESSION_RECOVERY.md. We were working on [task name]. Continue.
```

**Claude will:**
1. Read recovery doc (5 seconds)
2. Understand context
3. Continue exactly where left off

---

### **When You Return After Days:**

**You say:**
```
Read SESSION_RECOVERY.md. What did we finish? What's next?
```

**Claude will:**
1. Check checklist for completed tasks
2. Identify next task
3. Explain what to build next
4. Start coding when you're ready

---

### **When You Want to Skip Ahead:**

**You say:**
```
Skip Phase 2 for now. Let's build the billing system (Phase 3).
```

**Claude will:**
1. Jump to Phase 3 tasks
2. Note dependencies (may need Phase 0-1 done first)
3. Build what's possible
4. Flag missing dependencies

---

### **When You're Stuck:**

**You say:**
```
I don't understand how the provider abstraction layer works. Explain it.
```

**Claude will:**
1. Read PROVIDER_FLEXIBILITY.md
2. Explain in simple terms
3. Show code examples
4. Answer follow-up questions

---

## üìä Progress Tracking

### **How to Track Progress:**

**Option 1: Checklist (Manual)**
```
Edit 00_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md
Change [ ] to [x] as you complete tasks
```

**Option 2: Ask Claude**
```
You: "What % complete are we?"
Claude: [counts checked items, calculates percentage]
```

**Option 3: Git Commits**
```
Commit after each major task
Git log shows progress
```

## üéì Learning Resources (If Needed)

### **If You're New to These Technologies:**

**Hono.js:** https://hono.dev/docs
**Vue 3:** https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html
**FreeSWITCH:** https://freeswitch.org/confluence/
**PostgreSQL:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/

**But honestly:** Claude knows all of these. Just ask Claude to explain as you go.
