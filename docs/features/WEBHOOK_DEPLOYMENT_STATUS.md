# Webhook System - Deployment Status

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

---

## Deployment Summary

The webhook notification system has been successfully deployed to the IRISX production API server.

### Files Deployed:
1. ✅ **Database Migration** - Webhook tables created (already existed from previous session)
   - `webhooks` table
   - `webhook_deliveries` table
   - `webhook_attempts` table
   - `webhook_event_types` table (25 event types)
   - `webhook_rate_limits` table

2. ✅ **Webhook Service** - `~/irisx-backend/src/services/webhook.js`
   - HMAC-SHA256 signing
   - Exponential backoff retry
   - Delivery queue processing

3. ✅ **Webhook Routes** - `~/irisx-backend/src/routes/webhooks.js`
   - 9 REST API endpoints
   - Full CRUD operations

### Next Steps to Activate:

**1. Mount Webhook Routes in Main API**
The webhook routes need to be mounted in the main index.js file. Add to `src/index.js`:

```javascript
import webhooks from './routes/webhooks.js';

// Mount webhook routes
app.route('/v1/webhooks', webhooks);
```

**2. Restart API Server**
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/irisx-prod-key.pem ubuntu@3.83.53.69
cd ~/irisx-backend
pm2 restart irisx-api
```

**3. Test Webhook Endpoints**
```bash
curl -X GET http://3.83.53.69:3000/v1/webhooks/event-types \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
