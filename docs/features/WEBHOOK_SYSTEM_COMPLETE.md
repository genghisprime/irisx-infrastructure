## 💰 Cost Impact

**No Additional Infrastructure Cost**
- Uses existing PostgreSQL database
- Uses existing Node.js API server
- Outbound HTTP requests (to tenant endpoints) have negligible cost

**Future Enhancement (NATS JetStream):**
- May add ~$5-10/mo for dedicated queue server at scale
- Current in-memory queue suitable for 1,000s of webhooks

---

## 🔧 Integration Requirements

### To Activate This Feature:

1. **Deploy Database Migration**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/004_create_webhook_tables.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Service and Routes**
   - Upload `src/services/webhook.js` to API server
   - Upload `src/routes/webhooks.js` to API server

3. **Mount Routes in Main API**
   ```javascript
   // In src/index.js
   import webhooks from './routes/webhooks.js';

   app.route('/v1/webhooks', webhooks);
   ```

4. **Integrate with Existing Services**
   - Follow [WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
   - Add triggers to FreeSWITCH service (calls)
   - Add triggers to SMS service (messages)
   - Add triggers to usage metering (limits)

5. **Test End-to-End**
   ```bash
   # Create webhook
   curl -X POST https://api.irisx.com/v1/webhooks \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "url": "https://webhook.site/unique-url",
       "events": ["call.completed", "sms.received"]
     }'

   # Test webhook
   curl -X POST https://api.irisx.com/v1/webhooks/1/test \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

3. Add webhook marketplace (pre-built integrations)
4. Create webhook template library (Zapier, Make, n8n)

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Delivery Success Rate | > 95% | `successful_deliveries / total_deliveries` |
| Average Delivery Time | < 500ms | `AVG(duration_ms)` from deliveries |
| Retry Success Rate | > 50% | Deliveries that succeed after retry |
| Tenant Adoption | > 20% | Tenants with active webhooks |
| Events per Day | > 10,000 | Total webhook deliveries |

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Implementation:
1. **In-Memory Queue** - Not persistent across API restarts
   - **Solution:** Migrate to NATS JetStream (Week 4 per project bible)

2. **Single API Server** - Queue processing on one server
   - **Solution:** Distributed workers with NATS

3. **No Webhook Verification** - Endpoints not verified before activation
   - **Solution:** Add challenge-response verification like Twilio

4. **No Batch Delivery** - One HTTP request per event
   - **Solution:** Group events by endpoint, send batch

5. **No Event Filtering** - Only by event type
   - **Solution:** Add JSONPath filtering on payload
