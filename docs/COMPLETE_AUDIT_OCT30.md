---

## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Voice Call Orchestration (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Missing:**
- orchestrator.js worker
- cdr.js worker
- End-to-end call testing

**Impact:** Cannot make phone calls despite having all infrastructure!

### 2. FreeSWITCH Status (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Unknown:**
- Is FreeSWITCH actually running?
- Is ESL port 8021 accessible?
- Are Twilio/Telnyx trunks configured?
- Can we originate test calls?

**Need to verify:** SSH to 54.160.220.243 and check FreeSWITCH

### 3. NATS JetStream (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Unknown:**
- Is NATS running?
- Are streams created (calls, events)?
- Can workers connect?

### 4. All Frontend Applications (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Missing:**
- Customer Portal (0% complete)
- Agent Desktop (0% complete)
- Platform Admin Dashboard (5% complete)

**Note:** Backend is ~80% done, frontend is ~2% done!

### 5. Social Channel Integrations (LOW PRIORITY)
**Missing:**
- Discord
- Microsoft Teams
- WhatsApp
- Slack
- Telegram

**Note:** These come after core voice/SMS/email work

---

## ACTUAL CURRENT STATE

### What Works Right Now:
1. ✅ API server accepting requests
2. ✅ Authentication system (login, register, JWT)
3. ✅ Database with 99+ tables
4. ✅ Multi-carrier routing algorithm (LCR)
5. ✅ Multi-provider SMS/Email routing
6. ✅ Webhook system
7. ✅ Campaign management (backend)
8. ✅ Queue system (backend)
9. ✅ Analytics (backend)
10. ✅ Billing (backend)

### What Doesn't Work:
1. ❌ Making actual phone calls (no orchestrator)
2. ❌ Call recording collection (no cdr.js)
3. ❌ Customer can't use system (no portal)
4. ❌ Agents can't take calls (no desktop)
5. ❌ Can't monitor system (no admin dashboard)
6. ❌ Social channels (Discord, Teams, etc.)

---

## CONCLUSION

**We are approximately at Week 26 of 34 (76% through timeline)**

**Backend Progress:** ~80% complete
**Frontend Progress:** ~2% complete
**Overall Progress:** ~50% complete

**Biggest Gap:** Frontend applications (portals/dashboards)

**Critical Blockers:**
1. orchestrator.js and cdr.js workers (required for phone calls)
2. FreeSWITCH status verification
3. Customer Portal (customers can't use the system)
4. Agent Desktop (agents can't take calls)

**We're NOT at Week 4 - we're closer to Week 26!**

The backend is highly advanced with sophisticated features like:
- Multi-carrier LCR routing
- Multi-provider SMS/Email routing
- Campaign management
- Queue systems
- Analytics
- Billing

But we're missing the **workers that make calls work** and **all frontend applications**.

---

## NEXT STEPS (CORRECT PRIORITY)

### Immediate (This Week):
1. Verify FreeSWITCH is running and accessible
2. Verify NATS JetStream is running
3. Build orchestrator.js worker
4. Build cdr.js worker
5. Test making an actual phone call end-to-end

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks):
6. Build Customer Portal (Vue 3) - customers need to use the system
7. Build Agent Desktop basics - agents need to take calls

### Medium Term (Next 4 Weeks):
8. Complete Agent Desktop with WebRTC
9. Build Platform Admin Dashboard
10. Add remaining social channels (Discord, Teams, WhatsApp)

### Long Term (Final 8 Weeks):
11. Multi-region deployment
12. SOC 2 compliance
13. Production launch
