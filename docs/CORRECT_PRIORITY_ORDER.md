# CORRECT Development Priority Order
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Current Status:** Auth API Complete ✅ | FreeSWITCH Workers Next 🎯

## ⚠️ Important Correction

I was about to build the Platform Admin Dashboard, but that comes much later (Week 9-10). Following the Master Checklist, here's what we should build **in order**:

## ✅ Completed

1. **Authentication API** (Week 4) - DONE ✅
   - JWT auth with bcrypt
   - 9 endpoints (register, login, refresh, logout, etc.)
   - Deployed and tested in production
   - First tenant/user created successfully

## 🎯 Next Priority: FreeSWITCH Workers (Week 4)

### Missing Critical Components:

**1. orchestrator.js Worker** (NOT DONE ❌)
- Connect to NATS JetStream
- Consume from `calls` stream
- Connect to FreeSWITCH ESL (Event Socket Library)
- Originate calls via ESL API
- Handle ESL events (CHANNEL_ANSWER, CHANNEL_HANGUP)
- Update call status in database

**2. cdr.js Worker** (NOT DONE ❌)
- Subscribe to FreeSWITCH ESL events
- Parse CDR data from CHANNEL_HANGUP
- Write to `cdr` table in database
- Publish to NATS `events` stream for analytics

**Why These Are Critical:**
Without these workers, we can't actually **make phone calls**! They're the bridge between our API and FreeSWITCH.

## 📋 After FreeSWITCH Workers

### Week 5-6: TTS Integration (NOT DONE ❌)
- OpenAI TTS API integration
- ElevenLabs TTS (premium option)
- TTS caching strategy (Redis + R2)
- Call control verbs: Say, Play

### Week 7-8: Call Control Actions (NOT DONE ❌)
- Gather verb (DTMF + speech input)
- Transfer verb (blind + attended)
- Record verb (voicemail, recordings)
- Dial verb (connect to another number)

### Week 9-10: Webhooks & Customer Portal (NOT DONE ❌)
- Webhook delivery system with retries
- Customer Portal (Vue 3) - **This is when dashboards come in!**

### Later: Additional Channels
- Discord integration
- Microsoft Teams integration
- WhatsApp Business API
- Telegram bots
- Slack integration

## 🔍 What We've Actually Built

Based on codebase analysis:

**Backend API Routes (✅ Mostly Complete):**
- Auth routes ✅
- Calls routes ✅
- Email routes ✅
- SMS routes ✅
- Analytics routes ✅
- TTS routes ✅
- IVR routes ✅
- Webhooks routes ✅
- Campaigns routes ✅
- Queues routes ✅
- Billing routes ✅

**Workers (⚠️ Partially Complete):**
- email-worker.js ✅ (exists)
- sms-worker.js ✅ (exists)
- webhook-worker.js ✅ (exists)
- orchestrator.js ❌ (MISSING - critical for voice calls!)
- cdr.js ❌ (MISSING - critical for call records!)

**Services (✅ Mostly Complete):**
- Auth service ✅
- Calls service ✅ (has carrier routing, LCR)
- Email service ✅
- SMS service ✅
- TTS service ✅
- IVR service ✅
- FreeSWITCH service ✅ (ESL client exists)
- Multi-provider routing ✅ (voice, SMS, email)

**Database:**
- 99+ tables ✅
- Auth token tables ✅ (migration 024)
- Carriers table ✅
- Messaging providers table ✅

## 🎯 Correct Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: FreeSWITCH Workers

**1. Create orchestrator.js** (~300 lines)
```javascript
// Connect to NATS JetStream
// Subscribe to 'calls' stream
// For each call request:
//   - Connect to FreeSWITCH ESL
//   - Execute originate command
//   - Handle ESL events
//   - Update database with call status
```

**2. Create cdr.js** (~200 lines)
```javascript
// Connect to FreeSWITCH ESL
// Subscribe to CHANNEL_HANGUP events
// Parse CDR data
// Write to cdr table (partitioned by month)
// Publish to NATS 'events' stream
```

**3. Test End-to-End Call Flow:**
```
API POST /v1/calls
  ↓
NATS 'calls' stream
  ↓
orchestrator.js
  ↓
FreeSWITCH ESL (originate)
  ↓
Twilio SIP Trunk
  ↓
PSTN (actual phone call!)
  ↓
FreeSWITCH CHANNEL_HANGUP event
  ↓
cdr.js
  ↓
Database cdr table
```

### After Workers Complete:

**Then** we can build:
1. TTS integration (OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
2. Call control verbs (Gather, Transfer, Record, Dial)
3. Webhooks system
4. Customer Portal dashboard
5. Additional channels (Discord, Teams, WhatsApp)

## 🚨 Key Insight

We've built a LOT of API routes and services, but we're **missing the critical glue** that actually makes phone calls happen:

- ✅ We can accept API requests to make calls
- ✅ We can route to best carrier (LCR algorithm)
- ✅ We have FreeSWITCH running
- ❌ **We DON'T have workers to connect API → FreeSWITCH**
- ❌ **We DON'T have CDR collection from FreeSWITCH → Database**

Without orchestrator.js and cdr.js, **no phone calls can be made**, even though all the infrastructure is ready!

## 🎬 Action Plan

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Create `/IRISX/src/workers/orchestrator.js`
2. Create `/IRISX/src/workers/cdr.js`
3. Test making an actual phone call end-to-end
4. Verify CDR gets written to database
5. Then move to TTS integration
6. Then move to call control verbs
7. **THEN** build dashboards (Week 9-10)

**Dashboard comes AFTER core calling works!**

---

**Bottom Line:** We need to finish Week 4 (FreeSWITCH Workers) before jumping to Week 9-10 (Dashboards). The customer can't use a dashboard if they can't make phone calls!
