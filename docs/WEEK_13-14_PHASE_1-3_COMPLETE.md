## Key Decisions Made

### 1. TipTap Over Quill
**Decision:** Use TipTap for rich text editing
**Reasoning:** Better Vue 3 integration, more extensible, modern API
**Impact:** Cleaner code, easier customization

### 2. Multi-Provider Inbound Support
**Decision:** Support SendGrid, Mailgun, and Generic MIME webhooks
**Reasoning:** Flexibility for customers to choose their provider
**Impact:** More complex webhook handling, but greater value

### 3. Routing Rules Engine
**Decision:** Build custom routing rules engine with regex matching
**Reasoning:** Competitors charge extra for this, we include it
**Impact:** Differentiation feature, more development time

### 4. 4-Step Wizard
**Decision:** Multi-step wizard instead of single-page form
**Reasoning:** Better UX for complex process, guides users
**Impact:** More code, but significantly better user experience
