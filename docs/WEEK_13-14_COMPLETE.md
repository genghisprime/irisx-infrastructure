## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. TipTap Over Quill
**Decision:** Use TipTap for rich text editing
**Reasoning:** Better Vue 3 integration, more extensible, modern API
**Impact:** Cleaner code, easier customization

### 2. Multi-Provider Inbound Support
**Decision:** Support SendGrid, Mailgun, and Generic MIME webhooks
**Reasoning:** Flexibility for customers to choose their provider
**Impact:** More complex webhook handling, but greater value

### 3. Routing Rules Engine
**Decision:** Build custom routing rules engine with regex matching
**Reasoning:** Competitors charge extra for this, we include it
**Impact:** Differentiation feature, more development time

### 4. 4-Step Wizard for Campaigns
**Decision:** Multi-step wizard instead of single-page form
**Reasoning:** Better UX for complex process, guides users
**Impact:** More code, but significantly better user experience

### 5. Chart.js for Analytics
**Decision:** Use Chart.js with vue-chartjs wrapper
**Reasoning:** Most popular, well-documented, Vue 3 compatible
**Impact:** Rich visualization capabilities, proven library

### 6. Comprehensive Automation Engine
**Decision:** Build full-featured automation with 3 trigger types, 5 actions, rate limiting
**Reasoning:** Core differentiator, competitive with Mailchimp/ActiveCampaign
**Impact:** Complex implementation, but high value for customers

### 7. Deliverability Focus
**Decision:** Include DNS health checks, email validation, suppression management
**Reasoning:** Critical for email success, often overlooked by competitors
