## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Voice Routing Flow

```
1. User makes API call: POST /v1/calls
2. CallsService.createCall() invoked
3. carrierRouting.selectCarrier() selects cheapest carrier
4. Call record created in database with carrier_id
5. FreeSWITCH originate command generated
6. Call routed through selected carrier gateway
7. Call events update carrier health score
8. Cost calculated on call completion
```

### SMS Routing Flow

```
1. User makes API call: POST /v1/sms/send
2. messagingProviderRouting.selectSMSProvider() selects cheapest
3. Country code extracted from destination number
4. Provider selected based on:
   - Country-specific rates (if available)
   - Provider health score
   - Default rates
5. SMS sent via provider API
6. Delivery status updates provider health
7. Cost calculated and logged
```

### Email Routing Flow

```
1. User makes API call: POST /v1/email/send
2. messagingProviderRouting.selectEmailProvider() selects cheapest
3. Provider selected based on:
   - Attachment support (if needed)
   - Tracking support (if needed)
   - Provider health score
   - Rate per 1000 emails
4. Email sent via provider API
5. Delivery events update provider health
6. Cost calculated and logged
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. LCR Algorithm Design

The LCR algorithm prioritizes by:
1. **Health Score** - Exclude providers with health < 30
2. **Rate** - Select cheapest provider (if preferCost=true)
3. **Priority** - Fallback to priority-based routing
4. **Alternates** - Track 4 backup providers for failover

### 2. Health Monitoring

Provider health is automatically updated:
- **Success:** +2 points (max 100)
- **Failure:** -5 points (min 0)
- **Auto-disable:** After 10 consecutive failures
- **Recovery:** Health increases with successful deliveries

### 3. Cost Tracking

Every message/call is tracked:
- Provider used
- Rate charged
- Routing reason (lcr, priority, failover)
- Alternate providers considered
- Routing duration (ms)

### 4. Database Design

Key design decisions:
- `BIGSERIAL` primary keys (9.2 quintillion capacity)
- `JSONB` for flexible metadata
- Views for complex analytics
- Functions for business logic
- Indexes for performance
