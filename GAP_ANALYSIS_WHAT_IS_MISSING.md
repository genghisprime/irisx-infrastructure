# Gap Analysis: What's Missing from the Plan
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Purpose:** Identify what hasn't been built from the original 34-week master plan

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Progress:** ~50-55% of work complete, but NOT following the original plan.

**Key Finding:** You've built a DIFFERENT product than originally planned. Instead of a voice-first call center platform, you've built a multi-channel communications platform with exceptional SMS, email, WhatsApp, and social media capabilities, but with UNTESTED voice functionality.

## Bottom Line

**What Works:** SMS, Email, WhatsApp, Social Media, Customer Portal, Documentation
**What Doesn't Work:** Voice calls (untested), Agent Desktop WebRTC, Platform Admin
**What's Missing:** Campaign UI, Analytics, Load Testing, Beta Customers, Billing
