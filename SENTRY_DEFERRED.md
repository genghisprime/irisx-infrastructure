# Sentry Error Tracking - DEFERRED ⏸️

## Decision: Skip Error Tracking for Now

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** Deferred until post-beta launch

## Reasoning

- Currently in early development/beta preparation phase
- No real users at scale yet (error tracking most valuable at scale)
- AWS CloudWatch already captures all logs (free tier sufficient)
- Focus should be on revenue-generating features (email, WhatsApp, SMS improvements)
- Can activate in 30 minutes when actually needed (100+ users)

## What Was Completed

All integration code is ready and waiting in these files:
- ✅ `api/src/lib/sentry.js` - Backend integration
- ✅ `api/src/middleware/sentry.js` - Hono.js middleware
- ✅ `irisx-customer-portal/src/plugins/sentry.js` - Frontend integration
- ✅ `irisx-agent-desktop/src/plugins/sentry.js` - Frontend integration
- ✅ `docs/guides/error-tracking.mdx` - Complete documentation
- ✅ Integration guides for all 3 applications

**Status:** Code complete, not activated (no DSN tokens set)

## When to Revisit

Activate error tracking when:
- 100+ active users (manual debugging becomes difficult)
- Post-beta launch (after initial customer validation)
- Receiving frequent bug reports (need better debugging tools)
- Team grows beyond 1-2 developers (need shared error visibility)
- Revenue is stable (have budget for ~$30-42/month infrastructure)

## How to Activate Later

**Option 1: GlitchTip (Self-Hosted, Recommended)**
- Install on existing EC2 with Docker Compose
- Cost: $0 (uses existing infrastructure)
- Setup time: 30 minutes
- See: `SENTRY_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`

**Option 2: Sentry Cloud**
- Sign up at https://sentry.io
- Free tier: 5,000 errors/month
- Team plan: $26/month
- Setup time: 10 minutes

**Option 3: Stick with AWS CloudWatch**
- Already active, no setup needed
- Free tier: 5GB logs/month
- Good enough for small scale

## Current Monitoring Solution

**AWS CloudWatch (Already Active):**
- All EC2 logs automatically captured
- All Lambda logs automatically captured
- Can search/filter for errors
- Can set up alarms for specific patterns
- Cost: $0 (within free tier)

**Access CloudWatch:**
```bash
# View API logs
aws logs tail /aws/ec2/irisx-api --follow

# Search for errors
aws logs filter-pattern /aws/ec2/irisx-api --filter-pattern "ERROR"
```

Or use AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/

## Next Priorities (Week 13-16)

Focus on revenue-generating features:
1. ✅ Week 11-12: Beta onboarding, load testing (DONE)
2. ⏳ Week 13-14: Email channel integration
3. ⏳ Week 15-16: WhatsApp/additional channels
4. ⏳ Beta customer outreach and onboarding
5. ⏳ Marketing materials and sales

Error tracking can wait until we have customers paying us.

## Files to Reference When Activating

- `SENTRY_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Complete activation guide
- `api/SENTRY_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Backend setup
- `irisx-customer-portal/SENTRY_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Portal setup
- `irisx-agent-desktop/SENTRY_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Agent Desktop setup
- `docs/guides/error-tracking.mdx` - User documentation

**TL;DR:** Sentry integration is complete but not activated. We're using AWS CloudWatch for now. Will revisit after beta launch when we have real users at scale.
