# Case Study: Springfield School District

## Challenge
Springfield USD was using Remind for parent communication.
Problems:
- High cost ($8/student = $40K/year for 5,000 students)

- No emergency alert capability

## Solution
Switched to IRIS in Fall 2024.
- Multi-channel (SMS, voice, email)
- Emergency alert system
- PowerSchool integration
- Spanish auto-translation

## Results
- 50% cost savings ($40K ‚Üí $20K/year)
- 98% delivery rate (vs 85% before)
- Emergency alerts now delivered in < 5 minutes
- Parent satisfaction increased (survey: 4.8/5)

## Testimonial
"IRIS has transformed our parent communication. The emergency
alert system alone is worth the investment. During a recent
lockdown drill, we reached 100% of parents in 3 minutes."

## 10. Pricing Strategy

### 10.1 How to Price to Win

**Key insight:** Be 30-50% cheaper than incumbents, but not TOO cheap (raises suspicion)

**Competitor pricing:**
- Remind: $6-8/student/year
- ParentSquare: $7-10/student/year
- Blackboard: $5-7/student/year
- SchoolMessenger: $4-6/student/year

**Your pricing:**
- **Target:** $2-3/student/year
- **Result:** 50-60% cheaper, but not "too good to be true"
